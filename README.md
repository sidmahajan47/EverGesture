# ðŸŽ® EverGesture

Welcome to **EverGesture** â€“ an innovative project that lets you control your system volume using intuitive hand gestures! With EverGesture, your webcam becomes a dynamic tool for adjusting audio levels, making volume control as natural as a wave of your hand.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Real-time Hand Tracking:**  
  Use your hand to adjust the volume by simply moving your thumb and index finger. The distance between them directly maps to your system's volume.

- **Smooth Volume Transition:**  
  Interpolation ensures that volume changes are fluid and natural, eliminating any abrupt shifts.

- **Mute Gesture:**  
  A closed fist (all fingers down) instantly mutes your volume, offering a quick way to silence audio.

- **Dynamic UI Feedback:**  
  Enjoy real-time on-screen visuals including a volume bar, percentage display, and FPS counter for performance tracking.

- **Auto-Pause Mode:**  
  If no hand is detected for 5 seconds, the application automatically pauses the control mechanism and displays a pause message to save system resources.
